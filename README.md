My ruby based bot tools. Usually each file is an independent class you can include via require_relative. Just include this as a submodule.

EXIST

twurlrc-reader.rb - read in twitter key info from twurlrc on this machine
corporagulp.rb - read in a corpora json file and some minor manipulations

TODO

spaceadder.rb - replaces and adds various spaces in provided text to fluff it to make it not appear duplicate
profilesyncer.rb - utilities to make bots follow themselves, ensure they're in my lists, etc.
